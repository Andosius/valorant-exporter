# Valorant-Exporter
This program exports your current account settings and saves them to a file. Saved files can be uploaded to the server!

## Usage
Extract the zip archive and open your directory in file explorer.  
Login to your Valorant Account (you don't have to start the game - starting the client and logging in is enough) and replace your file-explorers path with `cmd` and press enter.  
  
For people with less experience:  
Your current path should look similar to `Your Computer (or Computer) > Downloads > valorant-explorer` - simply click the white / empty area and remove the whole path and replace it with `cmd`.  
Now write following command to start the exporter.

```
.\valorant-exporter.exe
```

All further steps are self explanatory.  
  
  
Have fun and wish you a great day! :^)
